    name          : Steffen Ridderbusch
    designation   : Secretary
    description   : >
      Steffen is reading for a DPhil in Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems, a topic that is too trendy for how much mathematics it involves. Apart from labouring over equations and code, he sweats through various workouts and might row again next year. Having recently discovered mindfulness, you might spot him sitting very still on a bench outside.

    designation   : Social Secretary
    description   : >
      Makiko is doing an MPhil in International Relations. Born in Japan, she has spent most of her life abroad in the States, Switzerland, and the UK, and she considers Oxford one of her favourite places in the world. When she is not discussing IR theories and historical evidence, she sings in the Oxford Belles, Oxford’s oldest all-female a cappella group. She loves Broadway musicals, Disney films, and British comedies (especially Blackadder!) and is always excited to meet new people.
      
      As Social Secretary, Makiko organises events for the MCR community, a task she finds particularly meaningful as the pandemic has shown us the value of staying connected. If you have any events you’d like to see or would just like a chat, please do get in touch!

    name          : Siddhartha Datta
    designation   : House Officer
    description   : >
      Siddhartha is pursuing a DPhil in Computer Science, robustifying neural network architecture against hurting others (and sometimes itself). When not working in the Wolfson Building, you will find him working in the MCR Spoom, working in the TV room, working … the pandemic closed all the fun stuff in Oxford, you get the picture. In another time and land, Sidd takes aerial photographs of cities and scenery with drones, proving once more that it is talent, not technology, that makes good art.
      
      Being House Officer means he is committed to pampering, nurturing, and investing in the Pavilion. His time goes to retaining a warm and positive atmosphere. This means keeping all the facilities clean and upgraded, providing new and exciting provisions for consumption or social use, and managing our MCR’s physical assets in this precious real estate.

    name          : Amalie Bronér
    designation   : Bar Officer
    description   : >
      Amalie is reading for an MPhil in European Politics and Society, which makes her a very dedicated committee member when she's got an essay she's trying to avoid. Her procrastination has driven her to be Bar Rep, keeping the MCR bar well-stocked and running smoothly for any other MCR members who need to procrastinate.
      
      When not serving drinks and restocking the bar, she is a keen rower and will try to recruit you to the boat club. She is lactose-intolerant and doesn't like cheese, which makes her Lorenzo's arch-nemesis. She's always on the lookout for new recommendations for drinks to add to the bar's stock for any student who needs to drown their sorrows.
